# Generic

The Generic layer is the first one that actually produces any CSS. It houses very high-level, far reaching styles. This layer is seldom modified, and is usually the same across any projects you work on. It contains things like normalize.css, global `box-sizing` rules, CSS resets and so on. The Generic layer affects a lot of the DOM, hence it being nice and wide in the Triangle model, and occurring very early on.
